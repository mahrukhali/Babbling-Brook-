            <h4> <b> Original Babbling Brook:</b></h4>
       
            This is the direct translation I got from the classic SuperCollider
            code.
            <ul>
              <li>Brown Noise</li>
              <li>3 biquad filters</li>
            </ul>
            However if we listen to the sound, it doesnt sound like babbling
            brook, rather more like a river. We dont hear any bubbles.
          </div>
          
         
          <div class="bab">
           <h4> <b>Babbling Brook:<b></b></h4> 
            
            <div>
              For the babbling brook, I used:
              <ul>
                <li>3 biquad filters</li>
                <li>2 gain nodes</li>
                <li> 1 brown noise</li>
                <li>1 buffer</li>
              </ul>
              The biquad filters consisted of: 2 lowpass and one highpass filter.This alone 
              will create the river sound as described above. The lowpass filters frequency were 14 and 400. 
              The high passfilters frequency was 400 as well. When I added the two gain nodes, I was able to hear
              the babbling brook sound. One gain node which is connected to the
              highpass filter creates the bubble sound which is set to 800 , this creates the overall
              sound shaping. The second gain node called gainNode reduces the
              overall volume to prevent clipping which was 0.1.
  
            </div>
             
           
        </div>
        <div class="q">
          <h3>Information:</h3>

          I wanted to create the phone buttons sound, which include the dial,
          ring and dialing a number. These sounds essentailly build up on each
          other. What I found most difficult was to create the phone
          buttons.
        </div>
        <div class="d">
          <h4><b>Dial Tone: </b></h4>
          For the dial tone, I used the frequencies provided in the textbook.
          I used the following:
          <ul>
            <li>Two oscillators</li>
            <li>1 gain node</li>
          </ul>
          To construct the tone,we need to add the sine waves, which occurs by
          connecting the oscillator to a gain node. I honestly was 
          suprised when I created the tone because it wasnt as complicated as I thought it would be and
          all I really needed were the right frequencies. The method in the textbook
          explained what frequencies and waveform I needed, all I needed to do
          was connect it. The oscillators frequency were 350 and 440. I made the gain node .125 to scale the frequency.
        </div>
        <div class="f">
          <h4><b>Ring: </b></h4>
          I wanted to create the sound we hear when we call someone on the
          phone, specifically iphone users (not sure how it sounds on android). I used the
          following which is similar to the dial tone:
          <ul>
            <li>Two oscillators</li>
            <li>1 gain node</li>
          </ul>
          This also requires the addition of the sine waves, however I also
          created a function that would allow the ring to stop and play again.
          Just as we hear on the phone. This was a little tricky. I could have
          used a buffer, however I didn't know how to create it with empty
          sound and I wanted the same timing everytime. I used set interval
          and changed the gain value with my toggle function. The frequencies 
          for the oscillators were 480 and 440. The gain node was set to .125 as well.
   
        </div>
        <div class="d">
          <h4><b>Dial Buttons: </b></h4>
          
          This was the hardest sound for me to create, as the connection to
          the different options was not working. To create the sounds, I
          used:
          <ul>
            <li>Two oscillators</li>
            <li>1 gain node</li>
            <li>1 biquad filter</li>
          </ul>
          Each option has tone pairings of 8 frequencies. I created an
          object that holds key-value pairs, where each key is a number or
          symbol, and each value is another object containing the two
          frequencies. I connected the two pairings to the gain node which connects to the biquad filter.
          This could have been implemented without the biquad filter, however it just sounds softer with it.
          The gain node again was set to .125 for scaling.
          <br>
          <h6> <b> Overall:</b></h6>
      
          I dont think I would be able to create the dial buttons or the ring without starting off
          with the dial sound. Each sound required a couple more steps and additions. I think if I started 
          with the dial buttons, I wouldnt know where to start or how to 
          connect or what to include regarding gain nodes and biquad filters.
